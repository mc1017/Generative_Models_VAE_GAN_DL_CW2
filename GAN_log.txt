Experimentations:
- paper hyperparameter
- deeper generator
- more feature maps in discriminator
- inner loop
- diff rl with scheduler
- feature matching
- change epochs
- 



0: paper = nothing shows up
1: paper + increased lr_G = slightly better colour, still messed up. 
2: paper (corrected using batch norm) = much better pics. shows images, although muted and unrecognisable
3: paper (adjusted discriminator archi, no tanh) = much better pics. shows images, no muted, some omeba like creatures
4: paper + label_smoothing (0.1, 0.9) = similar to 3, still a lot of omebas
5: paper + label_smoothing (0.1, 0.9) + data_aug (flip, rotate, colour) = rotattion create black boundaries
6: paper + label_smoothing (0.1, 0.9) + data_aug (flip, colour) = removed block boundaries, still omeba like, slightly disoriented
7: paper + label_smoothing (0.1, 0.9) + data_aug + deep layer = unrecognisable objects, omeba like
8: paper + label_smoothing (0, 0.9) + data_aug + deep layer = slight better object, still omeba like
